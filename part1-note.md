# Part 1

## Two options for setting up a react project

1. create-react-app - use for tutorials or experiments
    - ready to use built-in tools
2. vite - use for modern real-world apps
    - need to manually set up ESLint
    - extremely fast hot module replacement

### Framework built on top of React

-   This only makes sense for building actual products, not for learning React

1. Next.js
2. Remix

## JavaScript Fundamental for React

-   Destructuring, spread operator, template literals, ternaries
-   Promises
-   Async/await
-   Map, filter, reduce, sort

## React Fundamental

-   Core concepts: components, props, JSX
-   Creating and reusing components
-   Rendering lists
-   Conditional rendering
-   Start writing code on your own!

### Components as Building Blocks

-   React applications are entirely made out of components
-   Building blocks of user interfaces in React
-   Piece of UI that has its own data, logic, and appearance (how it works and looks)
-   We build complex UIs by building multiple components and combining them
-   Components can be reused, nested inside each other, and pass data between them
