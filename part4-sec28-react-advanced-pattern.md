# An Overview of Reusability in React

1. UI

-   Components
    -   use props as a component API, to enable custom behavior. Can be stateless, stateful, or structural components.
-   children prop
    -   To customize the component's context.

2. Stateful Logic

-   Custom hooks

3. Both UI and stateful Logic

-   _Render props pattern_
    -   For complete control over what the component renders, by passing in a function that tells the component what to render. Was more common before hooks, but still useful.
-   _Compound component pattern_
    -   For very self-contained components that need/want to manage their own state. Compound components are like fancy super-components.
