# Single-Page Applications (SPA)

-   Application that is executed entirely on the client (browsers).
-   Routes: different URLs correspond to different views (components).
-   JavaScript (React) is used to update the page (DOM).
-   The page is never reloaded.
-   Feels like a native app.
-   Additional data might be loaded from a web API.
