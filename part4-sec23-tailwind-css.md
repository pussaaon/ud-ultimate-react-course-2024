# What is Tailwind CSS?

-   A utility-first CSS framework packed with utility classes like flex, text-center, and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup (HTML or JSX).
-   Utility-first CSS approach: writing tiny classes with one single purpose, and then combining them to build entire layouts.
-   In tailwind, these classes are already written for us. So we're not gonna write any new CSS, but instead use some of tailwind's hundreds of classes.

# The Good and Bad About Tailwind

_The Good_

-   You don't need to think about class names.
-   No jumping between files to write markup and styles.
-   Immediately understand styling in any project that uses tailwind.
-   Tailwind is a design system: many design decisions have been taken for you, which makes UIs look better and more consistent.
-   Saves a lot of time, e.g., on responsive design.
-   Docs and VS Code integration are great.

_The Bad_

-   Markup (HTML or JSX) looks very unreadable, with lots of class names (you get used to it).
-   You have to learn a lot of class names (but after a day of usage you know fundamentals).
-   You need to install and set up tailwind on each new project.
-   You're giving up on "vanilla CSS"
