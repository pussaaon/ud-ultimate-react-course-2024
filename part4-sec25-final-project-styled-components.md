# The Project: The Wild OASIS

1. Internal Hotel Management App
2. Customer-Facing Website To Book Stays (Later)

-   "The Wild Oasis" is a small boutique hotel with 8 luxurious wooden cabins.
-   They need a custom-built application to manage everything about the hotel: bookings, cabins, and guests.
-   This is the internal application used inside the hotel to check in guests as they arrive.
-   They have nothing right now, so they also need the API.
-   Later they will probably want a customer-facing website as well, where customers will be able to book stays, using the same AP.
