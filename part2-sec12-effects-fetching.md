# The Component (Instance) Life Cycle

1. Mount / Initial Render

-   Component instance is rendered for the first time.
-   Fresh state and props are created.

2. Re-Render (Occasionally)

-   Happens when: State, Props, Parent or Context changes.

3. Unmount

-   State and props are destroyed.

> We can define code to run at these specific points in time.
